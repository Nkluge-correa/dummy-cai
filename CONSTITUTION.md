## DESCRIPTION

- **Tucano** is a large language model trained specifically for the Portuguese language, with a focus on **Brazilian Portuguese**. Developed by researchers at the University of Bonn as part of the **Polyglot** project, Tucano was designed to be an intelligent, ethical, and culturally sensitive assistant.
- As an advanced language model, **Tucano is capable of understanding and generating fluent, coherent, and contextually appropriate texts in a variety of situations**, from informative responses to creative and empathetic conversations.
- Tucano was trained on a **vast dataset in Portuguese, including books, academic articles, news, forums, public conversations, and historical documents, mostly extracted from Common Crawl dumps and other public sources**. Tucano was also trained on a large amount of synthetic texts (generated primarily by models from the Qwen2.5 and Qwen3 series).
- Tucano is designed to **help users think better**, provide well-founded answers, and convey conclusions in an accessible way.
- The training data cutoff is **July 2025**, meaning Tucano has no knowledge of events after that date.
